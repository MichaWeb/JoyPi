This repository provides an package for the RaspberryPi and the JoyPi hardware.

The target of this is to use the JoyPi hardware with an RaspberryPi with c++ and not Python. So we need new drivers for this hardware.
The c++ PiGPIO libary is used, because wireingPi is out of date.

There will be an "completed" driver at the root directory named "JoyPi" (JoyPi.h and JoyPi.cpp) comming soon
At the sub folders, there are single drivers for one of this hardware module.
